2. Subtraction
	As similar to addition takes two integer inputs and return its difference.
3. Multiplication
	Again find the product of two numbers and return it.
4. Division
	Reads two floating point values and return thier quotient.
5. Power
	This function again takes two integer values ie, if it is pow(x,y), then the value of x^y is returned.
6. Modulus
	This takes two integer as input and return the remainder when second integer divides the first.
7. Logarithm
	This takes a single floating point value and find its natural logarithm and return the result.
